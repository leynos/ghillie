# **A Comprehensive Guide to Testing Asynchronous Falcon Endpoints with Pytest**

## **1\. Introduction**

The Falcon framework is recognized for its high-performance capabilities in
building WSGI and ASGI web APIs and microservices, emphasizing reliability and
speed. A significant evolution in Falcon is its robust support for asynchronous
programming through asyncio and the Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface
(ASGI). This enables the development of highly concurrent applications capable
of handling numerous I/O-bound operations efficiently. However, the
introduction of asynchronous patterns brings new complexities to testing.
Verifying the correctness of asynchronous code requires specialized tools and
techniques to manage event loops and awaitables. pytest stands out as a widely
adopted Python testing framework, favored for its simplicity and extensibility.
For testing asyncio-based applications, the pytest-asyncio plugin is
indispensable, providing the necessary infrastructure to write and execute
asynchronous tests seamlessly. This report aims to furnish a comprehensive
guide on best practices for testing asynchronous Falcon endpoints using pytest,
covering environment setup, fundamental test structures, advanced control with
Falcon's testing utilities, asynchronous fixtures, effective mocking
strategies, and testing crucial components like hooks and middleware. A core
consideration when working with Falcon's ASGI interface (falcon.asgi.App) is
the pervasive nature of asynchronicity. It's not merely the endpoint responders
that become async def; this paradigm extends to hooks, middleware methods, and
error handlers, all of which must be awaitable coroutine functions.
Consequently, testing strategies must holistically address this "async
everything" model to ensure comprehensive validation of the application's
behavior.

## **2\. Setting Up the Testing Environment**

A well-configured testing environment is foundational for effective and
reliable testing of asynchronous Falcon applications. This involves installing
the necessary libraries, structuring the project logically, and configuring
pytest to handle asynchronous code.

### **Essential Libraries**

To effectively test asynchronous Falcon endpoints, several key libraries are
required:

- **Falcon:** The framework itself, specifically falcon.asgi.App for
  asynchronous applications.
- **pytest:** The core testing framework.  
- **pytest-asyncio:** The pytest plugin essential for running asyncio-based
  tests. It manages the event loop and allows the use of async def test
  functions.
- **HTTPX:** A modern, asynchronous HTTP client used to send requests to the
  Falcon application during tests.
- **pytest-mock:** A pytest plugin that provides a convenient mocker fixture
  for using unittest.mock.
- **asyncmock:** For Python versions prior to 3.8, this library provides
  AsyncMock, which is crucial for mocking asynchronous functions and methods.
  Python 3.8 and later include AsyncMock in the standard unittest.mock module.

These libraries can typically be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install falcon pytest pytest-asyncio httpx pytest-mock asyncmock
```

It is important to note that the source of AsyncMock—whether from the
unittest.mock standard library or the external asyncmock package—is contingent
upon the Python version utilized by the project. For projects employing Python
3.8 or newer, AsyncMock is readily available in unittest.mock. Conversely,
projects based on earlier Python versions must include asyncmock as a
dependency. This distinction necessitates careful consideration during
environment setup and when writing import statements for mocking utilities.

### **Recommended Project Structure**

A conventional project structure enhances clarity and maintainability. A
typical layout for a Falcon project with tests might be:

```text
my_falcon_project/
├── src/                  # Application source code
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── app.py            # Falcon app definition
│   └── resources.py      # Falcon resources, hooks, middleware
├── tests/                # Test code
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── conftest.py       # Shared pytest fixtures
│   └── test_resources.py # Test file for resources
├── .venv/                # Virtual environment
├── pyproject.toml        # Project metadata, dependencies, and PEP 735 groups managed by uv
└── pytest.ini            # Pytest configuration (optional)
```

This structure separates application code from test code, and conftest.py can
house shared fixtures accessible across multiple test files. Dependencies and
dependency groups (PEP 735) are declared in ``pyproject.toml`` and installed
with ``uv sync``. A similar structure is often suggested for web applications,
promoting modularity.

### **Configuring pytest-asyncio**

The pytest-asyncio plugin can be configured via a pytest.ini or pyproject.toml
file. A key configuration option is asyncio\_mode, which dictates how
pytest-asyncio discovers and runs asynchronous tests. Common modes include:

- **strict (default in recent versions):** Requires async def test functions to
  be explicitly decorated with @pytest.mark.asyncio.
- **auto:** Automatically detects and runs async def test\_… functions as
  asynchronous tests without requiring the decorator.

An example pytest.ini configuration for auto mode:

```ini
[pytest]
asyncio_mode = auto
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function
```

While auto mode can reduce boilerplate, it may obscure the asynchronous nature
of a test to readers unfamiliar with the project's configuration, especially in
mixed synchronous/asynchronous test suites. The explicit use of
@pytest.mark.asyncio, even when auto mode is enabled or if strict mode is the
default, enhances code readability and makes the test's asynchronous execution
context immediately apparent. This explicitness is generally recommended for
clarity, particularly in collaborative projects or when onboarding new team
members. The decision between these modes reflects a balance between
conciseness and the explicit declaration of asynchronous behavior.

### **Virtual Environments**

Utilizing virtual environments (e.g., via venv or virtualenv) is a standard
Python best practice and is strongly recommended. Virtual environments isolate
project dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects and
ensuring a reproducible environment. S2 specifically mentions virtualenv for
creating these isolated Python environments.

## **3\. Fundamentals of Testing Async Falcon Endpoints**

With the environment set up, the next step is to understand the basic mechanics
of writing and executing asynchronous tests against Falcon ASGI endpoints. This
involves using pytest-asyncio decorators and an asynchronous HTTP client like
HTTPX.

### **Writing Your First Async Test**

Asynchronous test functions in pytest are defined using async def and must be
decorated with @pytest.mark.asyncio. This decorator signals to pytest-asyncio
that the test function is a coroutine and should be executed within an event
loop, allowing the use of the await keyword for calling other coroutines. A
fundamental example of an asynchronous test function is:

```python
import asyncio
import pytest


# Assume my_async_function is an async function to be tested
async def my_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
    return "expected_value"


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_my_async_function():
    result = await my_async_function()
    assert result == "expected_value"
```

This structure, demonstrated in various forms, forms the basis for all
asynchronous tests.

### **Introducing httpx.AsyncClient for ASGI App Testing**

To interact with a Falcon ASGI application (falcon.asgi.App), an asynchronous
HTTP client is necessary. HTTPX provides httpx.AsyncClient, which is
well-suited for this purpose.1 A key feature for testing ASGI applications
directly, without needing to run a separate web server, is httpx.ASGITransport.
By initializing AsyncClient with ASGITransport(app=your\_falcon\_app), requests
are routed directly to the application in memory.1 This in-memory testing
approach offers significant advantages. Traditional API testing often involves
deploying the application to a live server and making network requests. This
introduces dependencies on the network stack and server process, potentially
slowing down tests and making them less reliable. ASGITransport circumvents
these external factors by directly invoking the ASGI application. This results
in faster test execution, improved reliability by avoiding network-related
issues, and tests that are closer to unit tests for the web layer while still
functioning as integration tests for the Falcon application's components.1 This
method is generally the preferred approach for testing Falcon ASGI endpoints
unless end-to-end testing with a specific server like Uvicorn is explicitly
required. The setup for using httpx.AsyncClient with ASGITransport typically
looks like this:

```python
import pytest
from httpx import ASGITransport, AsyncClient

# from my_falcon_app import app  # Your Falcon ASGI application instance


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root_endpoint(app):  # Assuming 'app' is provided by a fixture
    async with AsyncClient(
        transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="<http://test>"
    ) as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
        # Assertions follow
```

The base\_url="<http://test>" is a mandatory parameter for HTTPX, serving as a
placeholder even when ASGITransport is used, as HTTPX uses it for internal
routing logic.1 It is important to distinguish between Falcon's synchronous
testing client (falcon.testing.TestClient) and httpx.AsyncClient when writing
async def tests. While falcon.testing.TestClient can simulate requests to ASGI
applications, its design is primarily synchronous. Using its simulate\_\*
methods directly within an async def test function can lead to event loop
conflicts or improper asynchronous execution, as its internal mechanisms for
bridging synchronous tests to asynchronous applications may not behave as
expected in an already asynchronous test context. For idiomatic pytest-asyncio
tests, httpx.AsyncClient or Falcon's ASGIConductor (discussed later) are
generally more appropriate and less prone to subtle asynchronous issues.

### **Basic Request Simulation and Assertions**

Once the AsyncClient is set up, various HTTP requests can be simulated. Common
methods include ac.get(), ac.post(), ac.put(), and ac.delete(). These methods
are coroutines and must be awaited. Assertions can then be made on the response
object, checking attributes such as:

- response.status\_code (e.g., falcon.HTTP\_200, falcon.HTTP\_201)  
- response.json() for JSON payloads  
- response.text for raw text content  
- response.headers for HTTP headers

Examples of such assertions are found in various contexts.

### **Example: A Simple Falcon ASGI App and its Test**

To illustrate these concepts, consider a simple Falcon ASGI application and its
corresponding tests. **Falcon Application (src/app.py):**

```python
# src/app.py
import falcon
import falcon.asgi


class ThingsResource:
    async def on_get(self, req, resp):
        """Handles GET requests"""
        resp.media = {"message": "Hello, async world!"}
        resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200

    async def on_post(self, req, resp):
        """Handles POST requests"""
        # For POST requests, the request body is typically read asynchronously
        data = await req.get_media()  # .get_media() is an awaitable for ASGI apps
        resp.media = {"received": data}
        resp.status = falcon.HTTP_201


app = falcon.asgi.App()
app.add_route("/things", ThingsResource())
```

This application defines a resource with asynchronous GET and POST handlers.
The on\_post handler uses await req.get\_media() to asynchronously parse the
request body, a common pattern in Falcon ASGI applications. **Test File
(tests/test\_app.py):**

```python
# tests/test_app.py
import pytest
from httpx import ASGITransport, AsyncClient
from src.app import app  # Assuming app.py is in src


@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def client_app():
    # This fixture provides the app instance to tests
    return app


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_things(client_app):
    async with AsyncClient(
        transport=ASGITransport(app=client_app), base_url="<http://test>"
    ) as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/things")
    assert response.status_code == falcon.HTTP_200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Hello, async world!"}


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_post_things(client_app):
    payload = {"name": "My Thing", "value": 42}
    async with AsyncClient(
        transport=ASGITransport(app=client_app), base_url="<http://test>"
    ) as ac:
        response = await ac.post("/things", json=payload)
    assert response.status_code == falcon.HTTP_201
    assert response.json() == {"received": payload}
```

These tests demonstrate how to use httpx.AsyncClient with ASGITransport to send
GET and POST requests to the Falcon ASGI application and assert the responses.
This combination of defining asynchronous resources and testing them with an
asynchronous client forms the core of testing Falcon ASGI applications.1

## **4\. Advanced Test Control with falcon.testing.ASGIConductor**

While httpx.AsyncClient is suitable for many testing scenarios, Falcon provides
falcon.testing.ASGIConductor for more fine-grained control over the ASGI
application lifecycle.2 This tool is particularly valuable when testing
streaming protocols like Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets, and for
verifying the behavior of ASGI middleware lifespan events (process\_startup and
process\_shutdown).3 The ASGIConductor uses coroutines for its operations,
which means it integrates naturally with async def test functions. However,
this also implies that pytest-asyncio is not merely a convenience but a strict
prerequisite for using ASGIConductor within a pytest environment. pytest itself
does not natively execute async def tests or manage the await calls;
pytest-asyncio provides the event loop and necessary wrappers to enable this
functionality. Falcon's documentation explicitly directs users to
pytest-asyncio when using ASGIConductor with pytest.

### **Using ASGIConductor as a Context Manager**

ASGIConductor is typically employed as an asynchronous context manager. This
pattern is crucial because it automatically simulates the ASGI lifespan
protocol:

- **On entering the context** (i.e., the async with… as conductor: block is
  initiated), ASGIConductor sends the lifespan.startup event to the ASGI
  application. This allows any application-level startup logic or middleware
  process\_startup methods to execute.
- **On exiting the context**, ASGIConductor sends the lifespan.shutdown event,
  triggering shutdown logic or process\_shutdown middleware methods.

This behavior ensures that the entire application lifecycle, including these
critical startup and shutdown phases, is simulated within the test environment,
mirroring how a real ASGI server would interact with the application.3 This
capability is indispensable for accurately testing components like middleware
that rely on these lifecycle events. For instance, middleware might establish
database connections during process\_startup and close them during
process\_shutdown; ASGIConductor facilitates the verification of such behavior.
An example of its usage:

```python
import asyncio

import falcon.asgi
import pytest
from falcon import testing

# Assume 'my_asgi_app' is a falcon.asgi.App instance provided by a fixture or created directly.
class StreamingResource:
    async def on_get_stream(self, req, resp):
        async def stream_data():
            for i in range(3):
                await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
                yield f"data: Event {i}

".encode("utf-8")

        resp.sse = stream_data()  # Use resp.sse for Server-Sent Events
        resp.content_type = falcon.MEDIA_SSE


# Example app setup (could be in a fixture)
# my_asgi_app = falcon.asgi.App()
# my_asgi_app.add_route("/events", StreamingResource())


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_example_with_conductor(my_asgi_app):  # my_asgi_app fixture
    async with testing.ASGIConductor(my_asgi_app) as conductor:
        # For non-streaming endpoints:
        response = await conductor.get("/some_other_endpoint")  # Assuming this route exists
        assert response.status_code == 200

        # For streaming endpoints (conceptual, actual iteration depends on endpoint):
        # async with await conductor.simulate_get_stream("/events") as result:
        #     events_received =
        #     async for chunk in result.stream:  # result.stream is an async_iterator
        #         events_received.append(chunk.decode("utf-8"))
        #     assert len(events_received) == 3
        #     assert "Event 0" in events_received
```

The ASGIConductor ensures that process\_startup methods of any registered
middleware are called upon entering the async with block, and process\_shutdown
methods are called upon exit.3

### **Simulating Requests with ASGIConductor**

Within the async with block, the conductor object provides simulate\_\* methods
(e.g., await conductor.simulate\_get('/')) and convenience aliases (e.g., await
conductor.get('/')). These are coroutines and operate similarly to those on
falcon.testing.TestClient or httpx.AsyncClient, but within the managed
lifecycle provided by ASGIConductor.

### **Testing Streaming Responses**

ASGIConductor is specifically designed to aid in testing streaming protocols
like SSE and WebSockets. Methods such as simulate\_get\_stream allow for
interaction with streaming responses. While a detailed exploration of testing
specific streaming protocols is extensive, it's important to recognize
ASGIConductor as the appropriate tool for such scenarios. The result object
obtained from these streaming simulations often provides an async iterator
(e.g., result.stream) to consume the streamed data.

### **Relationship with falcon.testing.TestClient**

An ASGIConductor instance can also be obtained directly from an instance of
falcon.testing.TestClient by using the TestClient instance as an async context
manager.

```python
# client = falcon.testing.TestClient(my_asgi_app)
# async with client as conductor:
#     response = await conductor.get("/some_endpoint")
#     assert response.status_code == 200
```

This provides flexibility, allowing developers to use the familiar TestClient
setup and then "upgrade" to ASGIConductor when its advanced lifecycle
management features are needed.

## **5\. Mastering Asynchronous Fixtures in Pytest**

Fixtures are a cornerstone of pytest, providing a mechanism for setting up and
tearing down resources required by tests. When working with asynchronous
applications, these setup and teardown operations themselves may need to be
asynchronous (e.g., establishing an asynchronous database connection or
initializing an external async service client). pytest-asyncio extends pytest's
fixture system to support such asynchronous fixtures.

### **Need for Asynchronous Fixtures**

If a fixture needs to perform I/O-bound operations, such as connecting to a
database or making an HTTP request to an external service, it should be defined
as an async def function to avoid blocking the event loop. Standard pytest
fixtures are not designed to handle async def functions correctly; they would
return the coroutine object itself rather than its awaited result.

### **Creating Async Fixtures with @pytest\_asyncio.fixture**

To define an asynchronous fixture, the @pytest\_asyncio.fixture decorator must
be used instead of the standard @pytest.fixture. This special decorator ensures
that the async def fixture coroutine is properly executed within the
pytest-asyncio managed event loop, and its awaited result is supplied to the
test function. Failure to use @pytest\_asyncio.fixture for an async def fixture
is a common pitfall. If @pytest.fixture is used, the test function will receive
the raw coroutine object, leading to AttributeError or unexpected behavior when
the test attempts to use it as the actual fixture value. This distinction is
critical for the correct functioning of asynchronous tests. An example of a
simple asynchronous fixture:

```python
import asyncio

import pytest import pytest_asyncio


@pytest_asyncio.fixture async def async_data_loader():
    # Simulate an asynchronous I/O operation, e.g., fetching data
    await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
    return {"data_key": "async_value"}


@pytest.mark.asyncio async def test_using_async_fixture(async_data_loader):
    # async_data_loader will be the dictionary {"data_key": "async_value"}
    assert async_data_loader["data_key"] == "async_value"
```

This pattern, where @pytest\_asyncio.fixture is used for async def fixtures, is
consistently highlighted.

### **Async Fixtures with yield (Async Generators)**

For resources that require explicit cleanup after a test (e.g., closing
database connections, shutting down service clients), asynchronous fixtures can
be written as async generators using async def with a yield statement. The code
before yield serves as the setup phase, and the code after yield serves as the
teardown phase. An excellent example is creating an httpx.AsyncClient fixture
that is properly closed after use:

```python
import pytest import pytest_asyncio from httpx import ASGITransport, AsyncClient

# from my_falcon_app import app  # Your Falcon ASGI application instance


@pytest_asyncio.fixture async def async_test_client(app):  # Assuming 'app' is
a fixture providing the Falcon app
    # The httpx.AsyncClient itself is an async context manager.
    # Its __aenter__ and __aexit__ methods handle setup and teardown.
    async with AsyncClient(
        transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="<http://test>"
    ) as client:
        yield client
    # The client is automatically closed here upon exiting the 'async with' block.
```

This pattern is crucial for robust resource management in asynchronous tests.

### **Fixture Scopes with Async Fixtures**

Pytest fixtures can have different scopes (function, class, module, session) to
control how often they are set up and torn down. When using asynchronous
fixtures with broader scopes (e.g., session or module), careful management of
the asyncio event loop is necessary. pytest-asyncio's default event loop is
function-scoped. If a session-scoped async fixture attempts to run using a
function-scoped event loop, a ScopeMismatch error can occur because the loop
might be closed and recreated between tests, while the fixture expects to
persist across the entire session. To address this, the event\_loop fixture
provided by pytest-asyncio can be overridden with a broader scope to match that
of the async fixtures. This ensures that a single event loop instance is used
for all tests within that scope, allowing broader-scoped async fixtures to
operate correctly.

```python
import asyncio
import pytest


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")  # Or "module", "class"
def event_loop(request):
    """Override the default function-scoped event loop.
    Creates an instance of the event loop for the specified scope.
    """
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    yield loop
    loop.close()
```

This customization is an advanced topic but essential for optimizing test
suites that utilize expensive, shared asynchronous resources. Proper event loop
scope management prevents flaky tests and ensures efficient resource
utilization.

### **Example: Async Database Connection Fixture (Conceptual)**

A common use case for async fixtures is managing asynchronous database
connections.

```python
# Conceptual example using a hypothetical asyncpg-like library
import pytest import pytest_asyncio

# import asyncpg  # Example: pip install asyncpg

# Assume event_loop fixture is session-scoped if db_pool is session-scoped.
# @pytest_asyncio.fixture(scope="session")
# async def db_pool():
#     # Replace with actual connection details for your async database driver
```

pool \= await asyncpg.create\_pool( \#         user='your\_user',
password='your\_password', \#         database='test\_db', host='localhost'
\#     ) \#     yield pool \#     await pool.close()

\# @pytest\_asyncio.fixture \# async def db\_conn(db\_pool): \# Depends on the
session-scoped pool \#     async with db\_pool.acquire() as connection:
\#         \# Start a transaction that will be rolled back after the test
\#         async with connection.transaction(): \#             yield connection
\#         \# Transaction is automatically rolled back here

This illustrates how session-scoped connection pools and function-scoped
transactional connections can be managed using async fixtures, ensuring test
isolation and efficient resource use.

## **6\. Effective Mocking of Asynchronous Dependencies**

Mocking is a vital technique in testing, allowing for the isolation of code
units by replacing their dependencies with controlled test doubles. This is
particularly important for avoiding slow and unreliable external interactions
(like network calls or database queries) and for making tests deterministic.
When testing asynchronous code, the standard mocking tools need to be adapted
to handle awaitables.

### **Why Mock in Async Tests?**

The reasons for mocking in asynchronous tests mirror those in synchronous
testing:

- **Isolation:** Test a unit of code (e.g., a Falcon resource method)
  independently of its collaborators.
- **Speed:** Avoid slow operations like real network requests or database
  access.
- **Determinism:** Ensure tests produce consistent results by controlling
  dependency behavior. The primary challenge in async mocking is that
  dependencies are often async def methods, which return coroutines
  (awaitables) rather than direct values.

### **Introducing AsyncMock**

Standard mock objects from unittest.mock (like Mock or MagicMock) are not
directly suitable for mocking async def methods. This is because they are
synchronous and, when called, do not return an awaitable coroutine, which is
what the await keyword expects. To address this, Python 3.8 introduced
unittest.mock.AsyncMock. For Python versions prior to 3.8, the asyncmock
library provides an equivalent AsyncMock class. An AsyncMock instance, when
called, returns an awaitable. The return\_value attribute of an AsyncMock
specifies what this awaitable will resolve to when awaited.

### **Patching Asynchronous Methods and Functions**

The mocker.patch utility (from pytest-mock) or unittest.mock.patch can be used
to replace asynchronous functions or methods with an AsyncMock instance. The
core principle of patching—replacing an object where it is looked up—remains
the same. The key difference is that the replacement object must be an
AsyncMock.4 For example, to mock an asynchronous method get\_cat\_fact on a
CatFact class:

```python
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock  # Or from asyncmock import AsyncMock

# In your test:
# mocker.patch.object(CatFact, "get_cat_fact", AsyncMock(return_value=mock_response))
```

This replaces the actual get\_cat\_fact method with an AsyncMock that, when
awaited, will return mock\_response.

### **Configuring AsyncMock Behavior**

The behavior of an AsyncMock can be configured primarily through its
return\_value and side\_effect attributes:

- **return\_value**: This attribute defines the value that the coroutine
  returned by the AsyncMock will resolve to when awaited.

```python
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock

mock_async_func = AsyncMock(return_value="mocked_result_from_async_call")
# In the code under test:
# actual_result = await patched_function()
# actual_result would be "mocked_result_from_async_call"
```

- **side\_effect**: This attribute offers more complex control. It can be:  
  - An **exception class or instance**: The mock will raise this exception when
    awaited.  

```python
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock

my_mock = AsyncMock(side_effect=ValueError("Async operation failed"))
# In the code under test, awaiting this mock would raise ValueError.
```

- An **iterable**: The mock will return successive values from the iterable
    upon each await.  
- A **synchronous function**: This function will be called with the same
    arguments as the mock. Its return value becomes the resolved value of the
    awaitable, unless it returns unittest.mock.DEFAULT, in which case the
    mock's return\_value is used.  
- An **asynchronous function (async def)**: This async function will be
    called and awaited. Its result becomes the resolved value of the mock's
    awaitable. This is powerful for simulating more complex async behaviors.  
- Another **AsyncMock instance**: If side\_effect is set to another AsyncMock
    instance, calling the patched function effectively calls this other
    AsyncMock instance. The return\_value should then be configured on this
    side\_effect instance.

Understanding the interplay between return\_value, side\_effect, and the
awaitable nature of AsyncMock is crucial. For simple resolved values,
return\_value is sufficient. For dynamic behavior, exceptions, or invoking
other async logic, side\_effect is the appropriate choice. Misconfiguration can
lead to mocks not behaving as expected, for example, returning a coroutine
where a resolved value is anticipated by the test logic.

### **Verifying Mock Interactions**

Standard mock assertion methods provided by unittest.mock work seamlessly with
AsyncMock. These include:

- mock\_object.assert\_called()  
- mock\_object.assert\_called\_once()  
- mock\_object.assert\_called\_with(\*args, \*\*kwargs)  
- mock\_object.assert\_called\_once\_with(\*args, \*\*kwargs)  
- mock\_object.assert\_any\_call(\*args, \*\*kwargs)  
- mock\_object.call\_count

These assertions are vital for verifying that the code under test interacts
with its asynchronous dependencies in the expected manner.

### **Example: Mocking an Async Service Call in a Falcon Resource**

Consider a Falcon resource that depends on an external asynchronous service:
**Service (src/services.py):**

```python
# src/services.py
import asyncio


class ExternalService:
    async def fetch_data(self, item_id: str):
        # Simulates a real network call
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        return f"Data for {item_id} from external service"
```

```python
# src/app_with_service.py
import falcon
import falcon.asgi

from .services import ExternalService

# Assume service is instantiated and used by resources
# This could be a global instance or injected. For simplicity, assume global.
service_instance = ExternalService()


class ServiceResource:
    async def on_get(self, req, resp, item_id):
        # Calls the asynchronous method on the service instance
        data = await service_instance.fetch_data(item_id)
        resp.media = {"item_data": data}
        resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200


app_svc = falcon.asgi.App()
app_svc.add_route("/items/{item_id}", ServiceResource())
```

**Test File (tests/test\_app\_with\_service.py):**

```python
import pytest
from httpx import ASGITransport, AsyncClient

### **Table: unittest.mock.Mock vs. unittest.mock.AsyncMock**

To further clarify the distinction, the following table compares key features
of Mock and AsyncMock:

| Feature                     | unittest.mock.Mock                                         | unittest.mock.AsyncMock (Python 3.8+ or asyncmock library)    |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Suitable for**            | Synchronous functions/methods                              | Asynchronous functions/methods (async def)                    |
| **Return type when called** | Regular Python object (or configured)                      | An awaitable (typically a coroutine)                          |
| **return\_value attribute** | The direct value returned by the mock.                     | The value the awaitable (coroutine) resolves to when awaited. |
| **Usage with await**        | TypeError: object Mock can't be used in 'await' expression | Correctly awaits and yields the resolved value.               |
| **Primary Use Case**        | Mocking synchronous dependencies.                          | Mocking asynchronous dependencies.                            |

This table underscores why AsyncMock is essential for correctly simulating the
behavior of asynchronous dependencies.

## **7\. Testing Asynchronous Falcon Hooks (@falcon.before, @falcon.after)**

Falcon's hooks (@falcon.before and @falcon.after) allow for the execution of
custom logic before or after a resource responder method. When developing
asynchronous applications with falcon.asgi.App, these hooks must also be
asynchronous (async def).5 Testing these async hooks involves verifying their
intended effects on the request/response lifecycle and their interaction with
other components.

### **Defining Asynchronous Hooks**

Asynchronous hooks are defined as async def functions and applied using the
standard @falcon.before() or @falcon.after() decorators.5

- **@falcon.before(async\_hook\_func)**: The async\_hook\_func is executed
  before the responder.
  - Signature: async def hook\_name(req, resp, resource, params)  
- **@falcon.after(async\_hook\_func)**: The async\_hook\_func is executed after
  the responder.
  - Signature: async def hook\_name(req, resp, resource, req\_succeeded) The
    req\_succeeded parameter is a boolean indicating whether the responder and
    any preceding after hooks completed successfully.5

These hooks, being async def, are integral parts of the asynchronous request
processing pipeline. They can await other coroutines, modify req.context or
resp objects, or raise exceptions to alter the control flow. Thus, testing them
involves not only their isolated logic but also their integrated behavior
within Falcon's ASGI request-response cycle.

### **Strategies for Testing Hooks**

Testing asynchronous hooks generally involves:

- **Verifying Side Effects:** If a hook modifies req.context, resp.context, or
  response headers, tests should assert these modifications after a request
  that triggers the hook.
- **Verifying Behavior Modification:** If a hook is designed to alter control
  flow, for instance, by raising an HTTP exception (e.g.,
  falcon.HTTPUnauthorized in an authentication hook), tests should use
  pytest.raises to confirm that the correct exception is raised under
  appropriate conditions.
- **Verifying Conditional Logic:** If a hook contains conditional paths, each
  path should ideally be tested by simulating requests that meet those
  conditions.
- **Isolating Hook Logic:** When a hook has complex internal logic or its own
  dependencies, it's beneficial to mock these internal dependencies to test the
  hook's logic in isolation.

### **Using ASGIConductor or httpx.AsyncClient**

Requests to endpoints decorated with asynchronous hooks are simulated using
httpx.AsyncClient with ASGITransport or falcon.testing.ASGIConductor, similar
to testing regular asynchronous endpoints.

### **Example: Testing an Asynchronous Authentication before Hook**

Consider an asynchronous before hook for authentication: **Async Hook
(src/hooks.py):**

```python
# src/hooks.py
import falcon


async def authenticate_request_async(req, resp, resource, params):
    token = req.get_header("Authorization")
    if not token or token != "Bearer secret-token-123":
        # This will halt further processing and return a 401 response
        raise falcon.HTTPUnauthorized(
            title="Authentication required",
            description="A valid Bearer token must be provided.",
        )
    # If authentication is successful, add user information to the request context
    req.context.user = {"id": "user-xyz", "permissions": ["read", "write"]}
```

**Resource with Hook (src/app\_with\_hooks.py):**

```python
# src/app_with_hooks.py
import falcon
import falcon.asgi

from .hooks import authenticate_request_async


class ProtectedResource:
    @falcon.before(authenticate_request_async)
    async def on_get(self, req, resp):
        # Access user from context, set by the hook
        user_info = req.context.user
        resp.media = {"data": "This is sensitive data.", "user": user_info}
        resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200


app_hooks = falcon.asgi.App()
app_hooks.add_route("/protected-info", ProtectedResource())
```

**Test File (tests/test\_hooks.py):**

```python
# tests/test_hooks.py
import falcon  # For falcon.HTTP_OK, falcon.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED
import pytest
from httpx import ASGITransport, AsyncClient

# Assuming app_hooks is available, e.g., from a fixture or direct import
from src.app_with_hooks import app_hooks


@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def hooked_app_client(event_loop):  # event_loop from pytest-asyncio
    return AsyncClient(
        transport=ASGITransport(app=app_hooks), base_url="http://test"
    )


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_protected_resource_no_token(hooked_app_client):
    response = await hooked_app_client.get("/protected-info")
    assert response.status_code == falcon.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED
    response_json = response.json()
    assert response_json["title"] == "Authentication required"


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_protected_resource_invalid_token(hooked_app_client):
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer invalid-token"}
    response = await hooked_app_client.get("/protected-info", headers=headers)
    assert response.status_code == falcon.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_protected_resource_valid_token(hooked_app_client):
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer secret-token-123"}
    response = await hooked_app_client.get("/protected-info", headers=headers)
    assert response.status_code == falcon.HTTP_OK
    response_json = response.json()
    assert response_json["data"] == "This is sensitive data."
    assert response_json["user"]["id"] == "user-xyz"
```

This testing pattern, adapted from synchronous examples and using
httpx.AsyncClient 1, effectively validates the behavior of the asynchronous
authentication hook.

### **Mocking Dependencies within Async Hooks**

If an asynchronous hook itself calls other asynchronous services (e.g., an
external authentication provider or a database query for permissions), these
dependencies should be mocked using AsyncMock as detailed in Section 6\. This
allows the hook's logic to be tested in isolation. For instance, if
authenticate\_request\_async involved await
auth\_service.validate\_token(token), that validate\_token method would be
patched with an AsyncMock.

### **Asserting Hook Execution**

In cases where a hook's execution does not produce an immediately obvious side
effect in the response or req.context (e.g., a logging hook), its execution can
be verified by:

1. Mocking a function called by the hook and asserting it was called (e.g.,
   AsyncMock.assert\_called\_once\_with).
2. Having the hook set a specific, test-only flag or attribute that can be
   inspected.

These techniques ensure that even hooks with subtle effects can be reliably
tested.

## **8\. Testing Asynchronous Falcon Middleware**

Falcon middleware provides a mechanism to globally process requests and
responses. In an ASGI context, middleware components can also participate in
the application's lifespan events (startup and shutdown). Testing asynchronous
middleware involves verifying both its per-request logic and its handling of
these lifecycle events.

### **Understanding Async Middleware in Falcon**

For falcon.asgi.App, middleware components must implement asynchronous methods:

- async def process\_request(self, req, resp)  
- async def process\_resource(self, req, resp, resource, params)  
- async def process\_response(self, req, resp, resource, req\_succeeded)  
- async def process\_startup(self, scope, event) (ASGI lifespan)  
- async def process\_shutdown(self, scope, event) (ASGI lifespan)

The per-request methods (process\_request, process\_resource,
process\_response) are executed in a stacked manner based on the order they are
provided to the falcon.asgi.App instance.6

### **Testing process\_request, process\_resource, process\_response**

These methods are tested similarly to asynchronous hooks. Tests involve making
requests that pass through the middleware and asserting expected outcomes:

- Modifications to req.context, resp.context, headers, or response data.  
- Short-circuiting behavior (e.g., if resp.complete is set to True in
  process\_request, subsequent middleware and the resource responder should be
  skipped).
- Interactions with mocked dependencies within the middleware methods, using
  AsyncMock. httpx.AsyncClient or falcon.testing.ASGIConductor can be used for
  these tests.

### **Testing ASGI Lifespan Events (process\_startup, process\_shutdown)**

Testing process\_startup and process\_shutdown is a critical aspect of
validating ASGI middleware. These methods handle application-wide setup and
teardown. falcon.testing.ASGIConductor is the native Falcon tool for this, as
it simulates the full ASGI lifespan protocol when used as an async context
manager.3

- Entering async with ASGIConductor(app) as conductor: triggers
  process\_startup methods of all registered middleware.
- Exiting the block triggers process\_shutdown methods.

This allows tests to verify that resources are correctly initialized during
startup (e.g., database connection pools established, caches warmed) and
cleaned up during shutdown. Alternatively, for potentially more complex
lifespan scenarios or when integrating with other ASGI components, the
asgi-lifespan library can be used in conjunction with httpx.AsyncClient to
manage and test lifespan events. However, for testing Falcon-specific
middleware, ASGIConductor is generally the more direct and integrated approach.
A common pattern for sharing state initialized in process\_startup (e.g., a
database connection) with per-request methods or even resource responders is to
use the scope\['state'\] dictionary. The ASGI server (and ASGIConductor during
tests) ensures a shallow copy of this state is available in the scope of
subsequent request-response calls. Middleware can then transfer relevant items
from req.scope\['state'\] to req.context for easier access by responders.

### **Example: Testing process\_startup and process\_shutdown with ASGIConductor**

**Middleware with Lifespan Methods (src/middleware.py):**

```python
# src/middleware.py
import falcon


class DatabaseConnectionMiddleware:
    def __init__(self):
        self.startup_complete = False
        self.shutdown_complete = False
        # In a real scenario, this might be an actual connection pool object
        self.db_connection_info = None

    async def process_startup(self, scope, event):
        # Simulate initializing a database connection pool
        self.db_connection_info = "fake_db_pool_initialized"
        # Store in ASGI scope state for access by other parts of the app/middleware
        if "state" not in scope:
            scope["state"] = {}
        scope["state"]["db_pool"] = self.db_connection_info
        self.startup_complete = True
        print(
            f"Middleware: process_startup executed, db_pool: {scope['state']['db_pool']}"
        )

    async def process_shutdown(self, scope, event):
        # Simulate closing the database connection pool
        if "state" in scope and "db_pool" in scope["state"]:
            print(
                f\"Middleware: process_shutdown cleaning up db_pool: {scope['state']['db_pool']}\"
            )
            del scope["state"]["db_pool"]
        self.db_connection_info = None
        self.shutdown_complete = True
        print("Middleware: process_shutdown executed")

    async def process_request(self, req, resp):
        # Make the db_pool available on req.context if it was set in scope['state']
        if "db_pool" in req.scope.get("state", {}):
            req.context.db_pool = req.scope["state"]["db_pool"]
```

**Falcon App with Middleware (src/app\_with\_middleware.py):**

```python
# src/app_with_middleware.py
import falcon import falcon.asgi

from .middleware import DatabaseConnectionMiddleware

# Instantiate the middleware
db_middleware_instance = DatabaseConnectionMiddleware()


class DataResource:
    async def on_get(self, req, resp):
        db_pool_status = "not_found"
        if hasattr(req.context, "db_pool"):
            db_pool_status = req.context.db_pool
        resp.media = {
            "message": "Data resource accessed",
            "db_status": db_pool_status,
        }
        resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200


app_mw = falcon.asgi.App(middleware=[db_middleware_instance])
app_mw.add_route("/data", DataResource())
```

**Test using ASGIConductor (tests/test_middleware.py):**

```python
# tests/test_middleware.py
import pytest from falcon import testing

# Import your app and the middleware instance to check its state from the module
from src.app_with_middleware import app_mw, db_middleware_instance


@pytest.mark.asyncio async def test_database_middleware_lifespan(event_loop):
# event_loop from pytest-asyncio
    # Ensure initial state
    assert not db_middleware_instance.startup_complete
    assert not db_middleware_instance.shutdown_complete
    assert db_middleware_instance.db_connection_info is None

    async with testing.ASGIConductor(app_mw) as conductor:
        # After entering context, process_startup should have run
        assert db_middleware_instance.startup_complete
        assert (
            db_middleware_instance.db_connection_info
            == "fake_db_pool_initialized"
        )
        assert not db_middleware_instance.shutdown_complete  # Shutdown not yet run

        # Make a request to verify state is accessible via context
        response = await conductor.get("/data")
        assert response.status_code == falcon.HTTP_200
        assert response.json()["db_status"] == "fake_db_pool_initialized"

    # After exiting context, process_shutdown should have run
    assert db_middleware_instance.startup_complete  # Still true
    assert db_middleware_instance.shutdown_complete
    assert db_middleware_instance.db_connection_info is None  # Cleaned up
```

This example demonstrates how ASGIConductor facilitates testing the full
lifecycle of ASGI middleware, including the propagation of state from
process\_startup via scope\['state'\].3

### **Verifying Middleware Call Order and Short-Circuiting**

For more complex scenarios:

- **Call Order:** To verify the execution order of multiple middleware
  components, each middleware method can append an identifier to a shared list
  (e.g., on req.context). The test can then assert the final order in the list.
- **Short-Circuiting:** If a middleware's process\_request sets resp.complete
  \= True, tests should verify that subsequent middleware methods in the chain
  and the target resource responder are not invoked. This can be achieved by
  mocking methods in the downstream components and asserting they were not
  called.

## **9\. Strategies for Testing Error Handling**

Robust applications require comprehensive error handling. Testing these error
paths ensures that the application behaves predictably and provides meaningful
feedback to clients when issues arise. In asynchronous Falcon applications,
this involves testing Falcon's built-in HTTP error exceptions, custom error
handlers, and general Python exceptions.

### **Testing Falcon HTTP Errors**

Falcon provides a suite of HTTP exceptions (e.g., falcon.HTTPBadRequest,
falcon.HTTPNotFound, falcon.HTTPUnauthorized) that can be raised from
responders, hooks, or middleware to signal specific error conditions. When
these exceptions are raised in an ASGI application, Falcon (or the test client
simulating it) translates them into appropriate HTTP responses, typically with
a corresponding status code and a JSON body containing a title and description.
Tests should verify that:

1. The correct HTTP status code is returned.  
2. The response body (if JSON) contains the expected error details.

Example: If a resource expects a 'name' field in a POST request:

```python
# In a Falcon resource:
# async def on_post(self, req, resp):
#     media = await req.get_media()
#     if 'name' not in media or not media['name']:
#         raise falcon.HTTPBadRequest(
#             title="Missing Field", description="The 'name' field is required."
#         )
#     # … further processing…
#     resp.status = falcon.HTTP_201
#     resp.media = {"id": "new_id", "name": media['name']}

# In the test file:
@pytest.mark.asyncio async def test_post_item_missing_name(async_test_client):
# httpx.AsyncClient fixture
    response = await async_test_client.post(
        "/items", json={"value": 42}
    )  # Missing 'name'
    assert response.status_code == falcon.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST  # Or 400
    error_payload = response.json()
    assert error_payload["title"] == "Missing Field"
    assert "The 'name' field is required" in error_payload["description"]
```

### **Using pytest.raises with Asynchronous Code**

For testing scenarios where specific Python exceptions (not necessarily
Falcon's HTTP exceptions) are expected to be raised from asynchronous code,
pytest.raises is the appropriate tool. It functions as a context manager:

```python
import falcon import pytest

# async def some_utility_that_might_fail_async():
#     raise ValueError("An internal problem occurred")

# class MyResource:
#     async def on_get(self, req, resp):
#         try:
#             await some_utility_that_might_fail_async()
    #             resp.media = {"status": "ok"}
    #         except ValueError as e:
    #             # Example: Catch specific error, log it, and return a generic server error
    #             # In a real app, you might have a custom error handler for ValueError
    #             raise falcon.HTTPInternalServerError(
    #                 description=f"Internal processing error: {e}",
    #             )

@pytest.mark.asyncio async def test_operation_raises_specific_exception(mocker,
async_test_client):
    # Mock the utility to ensure it raises the expected underlying error
    mocker.patch(
        "path.to.some_utility_that_might_fail_async",
        side_effect=ValueError("Simulated problem"),
    )

    # If testing that the resource correctly translates this to a Falcon error:
    response = await async_test_client.get("/some_endpoint_that_uses_utility")
    assert response.status_code == falcon.HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
    assert "Simulated problem" in response.json().get("description", "")
```

```python
# If testing a function that should directly raise an exception (not caught by Falcon yet):
# async def my_raw_async_function():
#     raise TypeError("Specific type error")
#
# with pytest.raises(TypeError, match="Specific type error"):
#     await my_raw_async_function()
```

This is particularly useful for testing custom error handling logic within
responders, hooks, or middleware, or for verifying that unexpected errors are
gracefully handled or translated into appropriate Falcon HTTP errors. The match
parameter of pytest.raises can be used to assert the content of the exception
message. It is important to differentiate how errors are tested. If the goal is
to verify the API's error contract (i.e., the HTTP response for a given error
condition), one would typically make a request and assert the response status
and body. If the goal is to verify that a specific Python exception is raised
internally (perhaps to be caught by a custom error handler or to test a
non-HTTP part of the system), pytest.raises is used to catch that specific
exception type directly from the awaited call.

### **Testing Custom Error Handlers**

Falcon allows applications to register custom error handlers for specific
exception types using app.add\_error\_handler(SomeExceptionType,
my\_async\_error\_handler). In an falcon.asgi.App, these custom error handlers
must also be async def functions. This is consistent with the "async
everything" paradigm of Falcon's ASGI mode; the entire request-response cycle,
including error handling, operates within an asynchronous context. Tests for
custom error handlers should:

1. Trigger the specific exception the handler is registered for.  
2. Verify that the custom async error handler is invoked (e.g., by checking for
   side effects of the handler, or by mocking a function called within the
   handler).
3. Assert that the HTTP response generated by the custom handler is correct.

Mocking asynchronous dependencies *within the custom error handler itself*
might also be necessary if the handler performs async operations (e.g., async
logging).

## **10\. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls**

Adhering to best practices and being aware of common pitfalls can significantly
improve the quality, reliability, and maintainability of asynchronous tests for
Falcon applications.

- **Test Isolation:** Each test should operate independently, without relying
  on the state or outcome of other tests. Asynchronous fixtures, especially
  those using yield for setup and teardown (e.g., managing database
  transactions that roll back after each test), are crucial for maintaining
  isolation.
- **Avoiding Blocking Calls in Async Tests:** A critical pitfall is the use of
  synchronous, blocking I/O calls (e.g., time.sleep(), synchronous
  requests.get()) within async def test functions or fixtures. Such calls will
  halt the entire event loop, negating the benefits of asynchronous execution
  and potentially leading to slow tests, hangs, or incorrect outcomes. Always
  use asynchronous equivalents (e.g., await asyncio.sleep(), await
  httpx\_client.get()). This is not merely a performance concern; blocking the
  event loop can cause subtle failures that are difficult to diagnose.
- **Managing Event Loops Correctly:** While pytest-asyncio generally handles
  event loop management transparently, complexities can arise when manually
  manipulating loops or integrating with other asynchronous libraries that have
  specific event loop requirements. For fixtures with scopes broader than
  function (e.g., session or module), ensure the event\_loop fixture provided
  by pytest-asyncio is also appropriately scoped to prevent ScopeMismatch
  errors.
- **Writing Readable and Maintainable Async Tests:** Employ clear and
  descriptive test names. Structure tests logically, often following the
  Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. Keep individual tests focused on verifying a
  single aspect of functionality. Leverage fixtures effectively to reduce
  boilerplate and enhance readability.
- **Python Version Compatibility:** Be mindful of differences in asyncio
  behavior across Python versions. Notably, unittest.mock.AsyncMock is standard
  from Python 3.8 onwards; older versions require the asyncmock library.
- **Choosing the Right Test Client/Tool:** The selection of a testing utility
  should align with the testing objective:
  - httpx.AsyncClient with ASGITransport: Ideal for most endpoint
    request-response testing, offering speed and isolation.1  
  - falcon.testing.ASGIConductor: Necessary for fine-grained control over the
    ASGI lifecycle, testing streaming protocols, and verifying middleware
    lifespan events (process\_startup, process\_shutdown).3  
  - falcon.testing.TestClient: Can target ASGI apps, but for async def tests,
    it's generally preferable to obtain an ASGIConductor from it via its async
    context manager rather than using its synchronous simulate\_\* methods
    directly within an async test function. The choice reflects the depth of
    testing required; using an overly complex tool for simple tests can be
    inefficient, while using a simpler tool for complex scenarios (like
    lifespan events) will result in incomplete testing.  
- **Debugging Async Tests:** Standard Python debugging tools like breakpoint()
  (Python 3.7+) or pdb can be used. Logging can also be helpful, though care
  must be taken with asynchronous logging calls. Pytest command-line flags such
  as \-s (to disable output capture), \-x (to stop on the first failure), and
  \--lf (to run only the last failed tests) are valuable aids during debugging.

## **11\. Conclusion: Building Confidently with Asynchronous Tests**

Testing asynchronous Falcon applications with pytest requires a nuanced
approach that embraces the asynchronous nature of the framework and its
components. By leveraging pytest-asyncio for event loop management,
httpx.AsyncClient or falcon.testing.ASGIConductor for interacting with the ASGI
application, and AsyncMock for isolating dependencies, developers can construct
robust and reliable test suites. Key strategies involve:

- Setting up a well-defined testing environment with appropriate libraries and
  project structure.
- Understanding the fundamentals of writing async def tests and fixtures,
  particularly the correct use of @pytest.mark.asyncio and
  @pytest\_asyncio.fixture.
- Employing falcon.testing.ASGIConductor for comprehensive testing of
  middleware lifecycle events and streaming responses.
- Effectively mocking asynchronous dependencies to ensure test isolation and
  speed.
- Thoroughly testing asynchronous hooks and middleware, including their
  interaction with the request-response cycle and application lifespan.
- Systematically verifying error handling paths, including Falcon's HTTP errors
  and custom error handlers.

The adoption of these practices is crucial, especially given Falcon's common
application in building mission-critical REST APIs and microservices where
reliability is paramount. Comprehensive asynchronous testing provides the
confidence needed to deploy and maintain these systems effectively.
Asynchronous code, if not rigorously tested, can harbor subtle bugs related to
concurrency, state management, and resource handling. The techniques outlined
serve as a foundation for mitigating these risks. The landscape of asynchronous
Python and its testing ecosystem is continually evolving. Therefore, while this
guide presents current best practices, developers are encouraged to stay
abreast of new developments in Falcon, pytest, pytest-asyncio, and asyncio
itself. Continuous learning and adaptation will ensure that testing strategies
remain effective and leverage the latest advancements in the field. For further
information, the official documentation for Falcon (particularly its ASGI and
